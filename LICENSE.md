In particular, no claims are made for, or warranty of, the correctness
of results produced by these programs, or security of them, and no
liability shall result from their use or misuse.  Before sending funds
to any cryptocurrency address, it is {\em essential} to verify that you
possess the correct private key to retrieve them, and that this key is
stored securely in a manner that protects it from loss, theft, or
destruction.  Because the correctness and security of any computer
system depends upon not just the applications running on it, but the
language and system libraries they use, the underlying operating
system, the hardware on which it runs, and the personnel and procedures
which operate it, it is entirely the responsibility of the user to
independently verify the correctness of any results it produces and to
satisfy themselves of their security for the intended application.
